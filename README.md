Similar to Verilog and VHDL implementations, System C code for IEEE 754 Floating point unit 

IEEE 754 Floating-Point Module in SystemC
This SystemC-based implementation of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard provides a hardware-accurate simulation of floating-point arithmetic. The module supports standard single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) formats, including normalization, rounding, and exception handling.

Features:

Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Compliance: Fully adheres to IEEE 754 standard for floating-point representation.
Precision Support: Implements both 32-bit (single precision) and 64-bit (double precision) formats.
Exception Handling: Detects overflow, underflow, NaN (Not-a-Number), infinity, and denormalized numbers.
Rounding Modes: Implements multiple rounding modes (nearest, zero, positive, and negative).
Hardware Simulation: Efficiently models floating-point behavior for FPGA/ASIC verification.
Use Cases:

Floating-point arithmetic validation in digital design.
Hardware-accelerated computations in FPGA and ASIC designs.
Simulation and verification of DSP and AI-based applications.
